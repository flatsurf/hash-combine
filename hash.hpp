// Apparently boost's hash_combine is not very good
// (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35985960/c-why-is-boosthash-combine-the-best-way-to-combine-hash-values)
// It's maybe not so bad in practice but pulling in the entire hash.hpp header
// just for this one function seems a bit too much. (The hash_fwd.hpp header
// does not contain the implementation of hash_combine.)
// So we rolled our own hash_combine since strangely we could not find a
// header-only for that yet.
